# 🧱 BlockseBlock Mini Task 01

This is a mini blockchain simulation implemented using Node.js, showcasing the basic structure and functionality of a blockchain system.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the core elements of blockchain technology such as:

- Blocks containing data, timestamps, previous hashes, nonce, and calculated hashes.
- A simple proof-of-work algorithm to simulate mining.
- Chain validation to ensure blockchain integrity.
